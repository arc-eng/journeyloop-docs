    ---

    JourneyLoop's proprietary coaching quality model. Five principles — Surface Emotion, Hand Back Ownership, Illuminate Contradictions, Find the Pattern, Turn Insight into Action — with patterns, anti-patterns, and evidence-backed rationale.

    The AI session analysis is built entirely on this framework.
