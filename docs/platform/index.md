# Platform

Documentation for the JourneyLoop platform — what it is, how it's modeled, and the frameworks that drive its AI.

This section covers the **product and domain layer**: concepts that underpin everything else. If you're building a feature, integrating a new system, or configuring an agent, start here to understand the model you're working with.

## What's in this section

**[Overview](overview.md)**
The full platform reference: what JourneyLoop is, who it serves, the core data model (coaches, clients, sessions, goals, milestones, utterances), how sessions flow through the system, and what data is available via the companion API. Read this first.

**[SHIFT Framework](overview.md#the-shift-framework)**
JourneyLoop's proprietary coaching quality model. Five principles (Surface Emotion, Hand Back Ownership, Illuminate Contradictions, Find the Pattern, Turn Insight into Action) with patterns, anti-patterns, and evidence-backed rationale. The AI session analysis is built entirely on this framework.
