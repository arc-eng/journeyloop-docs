# Engineering

Documentation for how the JourneyLoop engineering team works — process, conventions, and agent protocols.

This section covers the **team and process layer**: how issues move through the pipeline, what each agent is responsible for, and how decisions get made and recorded.

## What's in this section

**[Process](process.md)**
The engineering process: issue lifecycle (from brief through spec, UX, tech spec, dev, and done), label taxonomy, planning conventions, and how agents collaborate. The single source of truth for how work moves through the system.
