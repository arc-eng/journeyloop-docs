# :material-state-machine: Engineering Process

How the JourneyLoop agent team manages issues, specs, and development workflow.

---

## Repos

| Repo | Purpose | Short Ref |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `arc-eng/journeyloop` | Django app (code) | JL |
| `arc-eng/journeyloop-startup-assistant` | Planning, roadmap, specs | JL-SA |
| `arc-eng/journeyloop-docs` | Documentation site | JL-Docs |

---

## Planning Docs: One Folder Per Feature

Every feature gets a folder under its project namespace:

```
planning/<project>/<feature>/
  ux.md             ← UX concept: layout, interaction, wireframes
  tech-spec.md      ← Technical architecture: system design, decisions
  plan.md           ← SWE implementation plan (created after all specs done)
```

!!! info "Product spec lives in the issue body"
    There is no `brief.md`. PM writes the product spec (user stories, acceptance criteria) directly in the issue. No separate file, no `plans/` folder.

!!! tip "Not every feature needs every file"
    Backend-only features skip `ux.md`.

**Example structure:**

```
planning/companion/
  memory-system/
    tech-spec.md
  interface/
    ux.md
    tech-spec.md
  skill-system/
    ux.md
    tech-spec.md
```

---

## Issues: One Per Feature

Each feature has **one tracking issue** in `arc-eng/journeyloop-startup-assistant`. The substance lives in the planning folder — the issue is lightweight.

### Issue Format

```markdown
## [emoji] Feature Name

| Vertical     | Status         |
|-------------|----------------|
| Product Spec | ✅ Done / 🔲 Not started / ➖ N/A |
| UX Concept   | ✅ Done / 🔲 Not started / ➖ N/A |
| Tech Spec    | ✅ Done / 🔲 Not started / ➖ N/A |

### Summary
One paragraph describing the feature and why it matters.

### Product Spec
User stories, acceptance criteria, and PM context — written directly here.
```

!!! info "Spec is the issue body"
    PM writes the product spec inline. No `brief.md`, no `planning/` subfolder for specs. UX and tech specs are still files in `planning/<project>/<feature>/`.

The status table is updated as verticals are completed.

---

## Lifecycle: Feature State Machine

Each feature issue carries **exactly one** lifecycle label at a time. The label answers: *"What does this feature need next?"*

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> needs_spec : Feature created
    needs_spec --> needs_ux : PM writes spec (in issue)
    needs_ux --> needs_tech_spec : UX concept done
    needs_tech_spec --> ready_for_dev : Marco approves in #development
    ready_for_dev --> [*] : SWE ships it

    needs_spec : needs-spec
    needs_ux : needs-ux
    needs_tech_spec : needs-tech-spec
    ready_for_dev : ready-for-dev
```

### Lifecycle Labels

| Label | Set By | Means |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `needs-spec` | — | Feature needs a product spec (written in issue body) |
| `needs-ux` | PM | Spec done, needs UX concept |
| `needs-tech-spec` | PM/UX | Ready for CTO to write tech-spec.md |
| `ready-for-dev` | Marco | Fully specced and approved, SWE can implement |
| `needs-po-input` | CTO | CTO needs product clarification |
| `needs-cto-input` | PM | PM needs technical assessment |
| `blocked-technical` | CTO | Technical blocker identified |
| `companion-tuning` | Marco/Agent | Prompt/behavior change only — routes directly to companion operator, skips standard lifecycle |

### Escalation Labels (to Marco)

!!! warning "Escalation labels trigger a ping to Marco"

| Label | Action | Means |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `needs-founder-decision` | :material-bell: Ping Marco | Above agent authority — options + recommendation |
| `needs-founder-approval` | :material-bell: Ping Marco | Both agents signed off, need go/no-go |
| `founder-fyi` | Silent | Awareness only |

### Fast-Track: `companion-tuning`

!!! tip "companion-tuning bypasses the standard lifecycle"
    Issues labeled `companion-tuning` require only changes to agent markdown or skills — prompts, response format, behavior instructions. No UX concept, no tech spec, no Marco review gate. The label routes directly to the companion operator, who applies the change and closes the issue.

    Use this label when the work is **purely behavioral** (no code, no data model, no UI). If in doubt, use the standard lifecycle.

## Agent Roles

| Role | Owns | Transitions |
|------|------|------------|
| :material-briefcase-outline: **PM** | Product spec (in issue body), acceptance criteria, prioritization | `needs-spec` → `needs-ux` or `needs-tech-spec` |
| :material-wrench-outline: **CTO** | `tech-spec.md`, architecture decisions, PR review | `needs-tech-spec` → (Marco reviews) → `ready-for-dev` |
| :material-palette-outline: **UX Agent** | `ux.md`, interaction design, wireframes | `needs-ux` → `needs-tech-spec` |
| :material-crown-outline: **Marco** | Founder decisions, approvals | Reviews tech spec in `#development` → `ready-for-dev` |
| :material-code-braces: **SWE** | Implementation, PRs, `plan.md` | `ready-for-dev` → done |

## Documentation Rules

!!! example "Every label change gets a comment"
    Explain **WHY** the label changed and **WHO** needs to act next.

### Comment signing

All agents sign their comments:

- `— PO Agent`
- `— CTO Agent`
- `— UX Agent`
- `— SWE Agent`

### Specs are files, not comments

!!! danger "Never paste spec content into issue comments"
    Tech specs, UX concepts, and briefs are **files** in the planning folder. Issue comments are **transition signals only** — one line linking the file. Pasting specs into comments creates drift if the file changes.

=== ":material-check: Good comment"

    ```
    Tech spec written: `planning/companion/interface/tech-spec.md`
    Removing `needs-tech-spec`, adding `needs-review`.
    — CTO Agent
    ```

=== ":material-close: Bad comment"

    ```
    ## Tech Spec
    ### Architecture
    We will use Django REST framework to...
    [2000 words of spec content pasted inline]
    — CTO Agent
    ```

### Acceptance criteria use checkboxes

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CompanionMemory model created with required fields
- [ ] Migration generated and tested
- [ ] Unit tests for model validation
```

When checking off criteria, comment what you did:

```
✅ Checked off "Add companion memory model"
— Added CompanionMemory in companion/models.py with migration 0001.
— SWE Agent
```

---

## Epics

Epics group related features. They're checklist issues — no specs or acceptance criteria of their own.

```markdown
## [emoji] Epic Name
Why this matters — 1-2 sentences.

### Features
- [ ] #XX — Feature Name (`current-label`)
- [ ] #YY — Feature Name (`current-label`)
- [x] #ZZ — Feature Name (`done`)
```

!!! warning "Max 2 active epics at any time."

---

## Implementation Issues

When a feature reaches `ready-for-dev`, implementation issues are created in `arc-eng/journeyloop` (the code repo):

```markdown
**As a** [role],
**I want** [goal]
**so that** [value].

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Testable condition (max 3 per issue — split if more)

## Planning
See: `planning/<project>/<feature>/` in journeyloop-startup-assistant
```

---

## plan.md

When a feature reaches `ready-for-dev`, **SWE** creates `plan.md` in the feature's planning folder. This is the implementation plan — written by SWE, not CTO — and captures how SWE intends to implement the feature before writing code.

!!! info "SWE owns plan.md"
    CTO owns `tech-spec.md` (architecture). SWE owns `plan.md` (implementation). These are distinct documents with distinct authors.
